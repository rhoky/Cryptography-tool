🔐 Simple Message Encryption & Decryption Tool

This project was created as part of my **3MTT Knowledge Showcase** under the **General Learning** category.

I developed a basic web tool that allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using the Caesar Cipher; one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. The tool lets users input a custom key to shift letters, demonstrating how basic cryptography works in a fun and interactive way.
